          <p>
            The fastest way to make sure you get what you want is to return the

            If the refund is approved, you will automatically be refunded
            according to your original payment method. Please keep in mind that
            it may take some time for your bank or credit card company to
            process and ship the refund. The product must be returned in its
            original packaging and cannot have been used beforehand.
