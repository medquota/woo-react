            <strong>SECTION 20 – CONTACT INFORMATION</strong>
            <br />
            If you receive a promotional offer subsequent to your purchase, you
            cannot, of course, claim a refund of the difference between the
            amount paid for the product and the amount offered as part of the
            promotion.

            <strong>SECTION 21 – PACKAGING</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            If the box or the packaging or branding of the product received is
            different from the images on the site, it means that the supply of
            the box or the product is insufficient. Therefore, we make sure that
            the product is in good condition to arrive at its destination, we
            use a white box or product instead which is similar to the original
            images posted on the website. We are not responsible and the product
            or box can’t be returned and refunded based on that change which has
            no effect on the product’s quality and use.&nbsp;
